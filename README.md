"Well, what now?" I was recently honorably discharged from the US Marine Corps and couldn't answer that question immediately. I knew I wanted to pursue a passion, so I went to school to study IT. It was tough making the transition from Infantryman to an IT professional, but I worked hard and finished the program. Today, I have my Security+, CompTIA A+, Network+ and Microsoft 900 Fundamentals certifications. In addition, I've graduated from Fullstack Academy's Cybersecurity Analytics Bootcamp where I'm learned key red team and blue team skills and the use of security tools. The passion I had for my military career has now shifted towards technology and I'm excited for what's next.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I love the art of Muay Thai.
